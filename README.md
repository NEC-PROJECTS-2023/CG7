# Introduction
If an Instagram profile is real or fraudulent is the major topic of our essay. All previous drug users' false and real account data will be used to train algorithms, and whenever we provide new test data, the trained model will be used to determine if the new account details are from real or fake drug users. The machine learning-based methods were used to identify bogus reports that might paint a negative picture of a person. To find a practical algorithm suitable for the given dataset, the dataset is pre-processed using a range of Python packages, and a comparison form is obtained. A variety of machine learning algorithms have a strong tendency to detect fake accounts on social media networks. For the purpose of identifying bogus accounts, the capabilities of the bracket algorithms Random Forest, Network, and support vector machines are applied.
